# Gotham font files

This project is configured to use the **Gotham** font.

Because Gotham is a licensed font, the font files are not included in this repository.

## Where to put the files

Place your Gotham webfont files in this folder:

- `public/fonts/Gotham-Book.woff2`
- `public/fonts/Gotham-Book.woff`
- `public/fonts/Gotham-Bold.woff2`
- `public/fonts/Gotham-Bold.woff`

Once present, the site will use these automatically via the `@font-face` rules in `src/index.css`.
